### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core **six (6)** columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

The data files used are as follows:
- [chicago.csv](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
- [new_york_city.csv](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
- [washington.csv](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)
